# 30‑60‑90 — People API (Absences) MVP

**Objective:** Ship a stable **People API** MVP (Absences) with two pilot countries, measurable health and clear governance.

## 0–30 days — Discovery & Foundations
- Stakeholders: Employee, Manager, HRBP, Payroll, Legal/Compliance, Integrations/IT (multi‑country).
- Domain model: Employee, AbsenceType, CountryPolicy, WorkCalendar, Request, Approval, Attachment, Balance.
- Contract‑first: **OpenAPI v1** as single source of truth (docs/SDK/Postman/mock).
- Security & quality: OAuth2/OIDC, scopes; **Idempotency‑Key**; audit/GDPR; version **v1**.
- Observability scaffolding: per‑endpoint **%4xx/%5xx** and **p95**, logs/traces with `client_id`.

## 31–60 days — MVP + Pilots
- Endpoints: `POST /v1/absences/requests`, `GET /v1/employees/{id}/absences`, `GET /v1/policies/{country}/absence-types`, `POST /v1/absences/{id}/approve`.
- Webhooks: `absence.requested`, `absence.approved`, `balance.updated`.
- 2 pilot countries (EU + LATAM). DX: TTFHW < 30 min (examples, Postman collection, errors RFC‑7807).
- Targets: **%5xx ≤ 0.1%**, **%4xx ≤ 2%**, **p95** within target.

## 61–90 days — Scale & Governance
- Country extensions (carry‑over, documentation, holidays), reporting/alerts.
- Dashboards by endpoint/version/client_id; alerts on 5xx & latency.
- Governance: changelog, **deprecation** policy (Sunset), release train.
- Business metrics: payroll incidents ↓, onboarding country ↓, HR/manager satisfaction ↑.
